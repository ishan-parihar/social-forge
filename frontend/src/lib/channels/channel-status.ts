// v25 F4 — ChannelCard status clarity.
//
// v21 shipped a 2px colored dot with a `title` attribute as the only signal
// for "is this channel healthy?". A `title` is invisible until hover, is
// unavailable to touch and to screen readers in practice, and cannot express
// *why* a channel is unhealthy. Every other surface in the app already had a
// labeled status chip; the channel list was the outlier.
//
// This module is the single source of truth for that signal. It is a pure
// function so the card, the context menu, and any future status filter all
// agree on what "expiring" means — the bug class where two components each
// re-derive a status slightly differently is what made this unreadable.
//
// Precedence is deliberate and total: a disabled channel that also has a
// dead token is reported as *disabled*, because "turn it back on" is the
// action the user can actually take. Surfacing "token dead" on a channel the
// user deliberately switched off trains them to ignore the warning.
